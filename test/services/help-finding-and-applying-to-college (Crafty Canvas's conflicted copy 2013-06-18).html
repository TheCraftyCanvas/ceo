<h1>Navigating the College  Process</h1>
<p>Applying to college is not what it used to be! A generation ago, the average high school senior applied to three colleges, in what was a far simpler and less stressful rite-of-passage than students face today. In the 21st Century, the college application process can be overwhelming and crazy-making!</p>

<p>This year, the typical high school senior will apply to 10 or more colleges. Some schools will accept The Common Application, but others will require their own paperwork, including supplemental applications. Different schools have different application deadlines. There are multiple essays to write, SATs and ACTs to be taken, scores to be reported, teacher recommendations to be solicited--and on and on and on.</p>

<h2>We reduce anxiety and increase productivity</h2>
<p>For any student engaged in the college application process, it can be frustrating and filled with anxiety. For students with poor focus and concentration, organizational and time management challenges, depression or anxiety—it can feel completely unmanageable. And when parents attempt to help their children apply to college, home can become a battlefield.</p>

<h2>No more fighting at home!!!</h2>
<p>At <span class="branding">Creative Educational Options</span>, we strive to remove the war zone from the home front! We work with students to navigate the college application process from soup to nuts, without involving parents who wish to be relieved of this duty. Our process is personalized and hands-on. We spend as much time with students as is necessary to complete the job successfully and on schedule. We are available to work with students after school, evenings and weekends. We get the job done, we get it done on time, and we get it done well.</p>

<p>My daughter got all of her college applications in on time and took the SAT for a second time. Every one of her scores improved. Her first-quarter grades placed her on the Honor Roll, and she remains involved in many after-school activities.  

None of this would have been possible without your wonderful guidance 
and support. The difference in my daughter’s attitude since she has worked with you is amazing!  She was floundering when she came to you.  Now she has focus, drive, and well-defined goals.  Thank you so much!</p>
