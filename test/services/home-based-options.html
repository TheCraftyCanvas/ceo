<h1>Home-Based Options</h1>
<p>Out-of-home treatment can be a wonderful gift to a struggling child or young adult. But it’s not the right option for everyone. Separation can be excruciatingly difficult fort family members. The cost of residential treatment is staggering for many.</p>

<p><span class="branding">Home-Based Options</span> provides one last alternative to sending a family member away from the fold. And it also protects your investment when your child of any age returns home after residential treatment.</p>

<h2>Coaches and Mentors</h2>

<p><span class="branding">Home-Based Options</span> provides a coach for parents and a mentor for the challenging child, teen or adult. The mentor serves as the child’s advocate, sounding board and voice of reason. He or she meets with the child at home or in local venues for weekly sessions which could include a Starbucks run, a quick meal, hiking, biking, bowling, rock climbing, shooting baskets, playing tennis, or shopping. Within the parameters of a safe environment, the sky is the limit. And meaningful conversation, which does not feel like conventional therapy, is always a part of the equation.</p>

<p>Kids and young adults have access to mentors between visits, through e-mail, texting and cell phones.</p>

<p>Mentors, who are supervised by a licensed psychologist or social worker, are also available to work with siblings either regularly or on an as-needed basis.</p>

<p>The coach is the parents’ go-to person. Working as a team, parents and coach design and implement effective strategies for parenting the challenging offspring. The coach meets weekly with parents, and is available to them as needed between sessions.</p>

<p><span class="branding">Home-Based Options</span> provides customized service packages. Fees are determined by the number of face-to-face and on-call hours per contract period of one, three, six or twelve months.</p>

<p>With this exciting and innovative service...</p>
