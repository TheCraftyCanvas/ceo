<h1>Why Hire Creative Educational Options as <em>YOUR</em>  Consultant?</h1>
<p>Our frightening economic climate compounds the stress of having a child with special academic and emotional needs. Many parents—already in the grip of fear and despair—turn to the Internet and social networks in a frantic quest for help, only to encounter information overload. </p>
<h2>When it comes to your child's wellbeing, you cannot afford to make mistakes!</h2>
<p>At Creative Educational Options, we are driven only by the needs of our clients. We know which programs are reputable, and which are not. </p>
<h2>We do the research and the legwork. </h2>
<p>We are constantly on the road—evaluating schools, programs, and the professionals who run them. We go behind the scenes, ask the hard questions, and find out who delivers the goods they claim to deliver!</p>
<h2>We provide sympathetic ears and emotional support every step of the way!</h2>
<p>Once you have chosen a school or treatment program, we stay with you! We serve as a liaison between you and the people working with your child. We speak with teachers, advisors and therapists—the key players in the student's life. If there's a problem, we work with you to solve it.</p>
<p>Because of the consistency of communication among all parties invested in your child's care and education, we can help you to plan a smooth and timely transition either to home or to the next appropriate placement. Be it a public school, less restrictive private school, college or unconventional post-secondary venue, you can count on us for the help and support that you and your child deserve through every step of this challenging process.</p>
<h2>Operated by a Licensed Psychologist</h2>
<p>Why pay two separate parties for help, when you can have the best of both worlds? Our consultation and therapy services are unique- allowing us to form a critical bond and understanding of your situation and needs.</p>
