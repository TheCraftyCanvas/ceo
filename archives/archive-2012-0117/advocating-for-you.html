<h1>We are your advocate and case manager</h1>
<p>At Creative Educational Options, we know all about the periodic frustration, fear, despair, confusion, sadness and sorrow experienced by every parent of a child with special needs.</p>

<p>And we know about the anxiety inherent to every search for traditional schools and colleges for average and gifted students.</p>

<p>So we offer you more than a list of options! We collaborate with you as you make the really tough decisions on behalf of your child.  We provide advice, a sympathetic ear, and lots of support--every step of the way.</p>

<p>Once you have chosen a school or treatment program, we stay with you! We serve as a liaison between you and the people working with your child. We speak with teachers, advisers and therapistsâ€”the key players in the student's life. If there's a problem, we help you to solve it.</p>

<p>Because of the consistency of communication among all parties invested in your child's care and education, we can help you to plan a smooth and timely transition either to home or to the next appropriate place. Be it a public school, less restrictive private school, college, or an unconventional post-secondary venue, you can count on us for the help and support that you and your child deserve through every step of this challenging process.</p>

The difference in my daughter from last year to this one is nothing short of astonishing!  I could not be more proud of the work she has done!  When do we begin the college search?
