<h1>Why Hire an Educational Consultant?</h1>
<p>Our frightening economic climate compounds the stress of having a child with special academic and emotional needs. Many parents—already in the grip of fear and despair—turn to the Internet and social networks in a frantic quest for help. What they find is a plethora of information about hundreds of schools and treatment programs claiming to be "the cure."</p>

<p>Any program can provide you with a glitzy web site, a shiny brochure, and lots of rhetoric. But sadly, not all of these programs--and not all of the people who represent them--are competent or scrupulous. In some cases, the need to fill beds can lead to manipulative and misleading marketing. In some programs, your child might not be safe, or might not receive the help s/he needs.</p>
<h2>We help you get it right the first time</h2>
<p>When it comes to your child's well-being, you cannot afford to make mistakes! At <span class="branding">Creative Educational Options</span>, we are driven only by the needs of our clients. We know which programs are reputable, and which are not. Our fee represents an additional expense for you, and it might be difficult to justify. But it makes no sense, given the significant cost of special schools and treatment programs, to be "penny-wise and pound-foolish" as you look for the best help for your child. In most cases, our fee is less than the cost of <span style="font-weight:bold;">one month</span> at a boarding school or treatment facility.</p>
<h2>We scrutinize programs with objectivity and expertise</h2>
<p>It's foolish to bypass the service of an independent educational consultant, and heed the advice of a marketer paid by a program to reel you in. At <span class="branding">Creative Educational Options</span>, we do the research and the legwork for you. We are constantly on the road—evaluating schools, programs, and the professionals who run them. We go behind the scenes, ask the hard questions, and find out who delivers the goods they claim to deliver!</p>
