<p>When my wife and I met Nancy, we were at our wits’ end! Like so many others, our son had been severely damaged by the educational system that was supposed to protect him. We felt we had nowhere to turn.</p>

<p>Within a short period of time, Nancy helped us to navigate the system, and find the best place for our son to receive appropriate schooling and therapy.</p>

<p>Today our son is at grade-level, and is developing socially in ways we could never have imagined. We have our son back, and we are convinced that none of this would have been possible without Nancy.</p>
