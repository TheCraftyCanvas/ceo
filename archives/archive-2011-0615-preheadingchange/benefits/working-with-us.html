<h1>Why Hire an Educational Consultant?</h1>
<p>Our frightening economic climate compounds the stress of having a child with special academic and emotional needs. Many parents&mdash;already in the grip of fear and despair&mdash;turn to the Internet and social networks in a frantic quest for help. What they find is a plethora of information about hundreds of schools and treatment programs claiming to be "the cure."</p>

<p>Any program can provide you with a glitzy web site, a shiny brochure, and lots of rhetoric. But sadly, not all of these programs&mdash;and not all of the people who represent them&mdash;are competent or scrupulous. In some cases, the need to fill beds can lead to manipulative and misleading marketing. In some programs, your child might not be safe, or might not receive the help s/he needs.</p>

<h2>We help you get it right the first time</h2>
<p>When it comes to your child's well-being, you cannot afford to make mistakes! At <span class="branding">Creative Educational Options</span>, we are driven only by the needs of our clients. We know which programs are reputable, and which are not. Our fee represents an additional expense for you, and it might be difficult to justify. But it makes no sense, given the significant cost of special schools and treatment programs, to be "penny-wise and pound-foolish" as you look for the best help for your child. In most cases, our fee is less than the cost of <span class="green_emphasis">one month</span> at a boarding school or treatment facility.</p>

<h2>We scrutinize programs with objectivity and expertise</h2>
<p>It's foolish to bypass the service of an independent educational consultant, and heed the advice of a marketer paid by a program to reel you in. We do the research and the legwork for you. We are constantly on the roadâ€”evaluating schools, programs, and the professionals who run them. We go behind the scenes, ask the hard questions, and find out who delivers the goods they claim to deliver!</p>

<p>When we began working with you, we were lost and confused about what to do to help our son. He had just turned 12, and we had no idea what our options were, or how we could even consider placing him outside our home. Your confidence and compassion made it possible for us to get the help our son so desperately needed. You clearly care deeply about our child, and have remained in constant contact with us throughout this painful process. There have been bumps in the road, but your support, expertise and genuine concern have carried us over them. It was heartbreaking to send our child away, but the positive changes in him are profound. He is becoming a mature young adult, he will be back at home with us again soon, and we look forward to a bright future for our son.</p>
