<h1>Fighting the Addiction Monster</h1>
<p>Addictions of all kinds plague adolescents, adults&mdash;even children in grade school. Prescription drugs. Street drugs. Alcohol. Food. Gambling. Sex. Shopping. Social media. Technology. Gaming. The possibilities for over-indulgence are endless.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of desperate individuals seek addiction treatment each day. And for every one who recognizes loss of control, there are 10 others denying that they have a problem.</p>

<p>Every day, in the United States, families are decimated by the addictions of loved ones. Compulsive use of computers and video games can make it impossible for kids to get to bed at night, and then to get to school in the morning. There is documentation of once-responsible adults who have taken their own lives, because the stranglehold of addictions made it impossible for them to eat, sleep, work, or support their families.</p>

<p>At <span class="branding">Creative Educational Options</span>, we can work with you to find a variety of programs and professionals who treat addicts, while also addressing the emotional factors that created their problems.</p>

<p>When addiction is destroying a loved one, and ruining your family...</p>

<p>In the summer of 11th grade, my life was spinning out of control.  I had nowhere to turn, and was not open to getting treatment.  The thought of being sent away from home was my biggest fear. That’s when my parents found Nancy Greene.  I remember sitting in her office and answering her questions.  When we finished, I said, "I know I need help, and I'm willing to go."</p>

<p>I was sent to a girls' therapeutic boarding school.  I spent many months there, and honestly, they were the best months of my life.  It wasn’t an easy process, but I learned so much!</p>

<p>Now I'm an adult, living in my own apartment and pursuing a college degree in psychology. I owe a lot of thanks to Nancy Greene for her support and kind words.  I hope your son or daughter will get the same chance I had, and get back on the right track in life!</p>
