<h1>Your Advocate and Case Manager</h1>
<p>At <span class="branding">Creative Educational Options</span>, we know all about the periodic frustration, fear, despair, confusion, sadness and sorrow experienced by every parent of a child with special needs.</p>

<p>And we know about the anxiety inherent to searching for alternatives to post-secondary school programs.</p>

<p>So we offer you more than a list of options! We collaborate with you as you make the really tough decisions on behalf of your child.  We provide advice, a sympathetic ear, and lots of support--every step of the way.</p>

<p>Once you have chosen a <span class="in_context_link"><a href="services/finding-solutions-alternative-options.html">school or treatment program</a></span>, we stay with you! We serve as a liaison between you and the people working with your child. We speak with teachers, advisers and therapists—the key players in the student's life. If there's a problem, we help you to solve it.</p>

<p>Because of the consistency of communication among all parties invested in your child's care and education, we can help you to plan a smooth and timely transition either to home or to the next appropriate place. Be it a public school, less restrictive private school, college, or an unconventional post-secondary venue, you can count on us for the help and support that you and your child deserve through every step of this challenging process.</p>

<p>With every twist and turn, you had my son’s best interests at heart.  The wilderness program you recommended was the right one for him.  The school that followed was an excellent academic choice.  And you were the architect of the whole process!  My son may never know or appreciate the care with which you crafted this path for him, but I do.  And you have my eternal and heartfelt gratitude.</p>
